            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 16px;">I know many have the attention span of a gnat so move on.<br>
            I am not interested and as these are verifiable facts.<br>
            For those of you who wish to criticize me save it.<br>
            Read the links, I know many of you Republican Whiners never read anything just complain.<br>
            If this bill finally makes it I will be there to tell you "I told you so!"</p>

        <h1>Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" - The End of American Democracy</h1>

        <div class="alert-box">
            <h2>🚨 THE DESTRUCTION OF AMERICAN FREEDOM 🚨</h2>
            <h3>Trump Just Made Himself King</h3>
            
            <p>The most terrifying part of this bill isn't the money - it's that Trump has just destroyed the system that protects your freedom. Buried in the 1,100 pages is a provision that <strong>strips federal judges of their power to stop Trump from breaking the law.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>What this means for YOUR freedom:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Federal courts can no longer punish Trump's administration when they ignore court orders</li>
                <li>Judges become powerless puppets who can issue orders but can't enforce them</li>
                <li>Trump can now completely ignore any court that tries to stop him</li>
                <li>Your constitutional rights are now unenforceable if Trump decides to violate them</li>
                <li>With a conservative Supreme Court and Republican Congress, Trump controls all three branches of government</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>This is how democracy dies.</strong> The provision is retroactive, meaning Trump can ignore court orders that were issued before this bill even passed. Legal experts are calling this the end of the rule of law in America.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>💰 THE BIGGEST WEALTH HEIST IN HISTORY 💰</h2>
        <h3>Billionaires Steal Everything While You Get Screwed</h3>
        
        <p>While Trump was destroying your freedom, he was also orchestrating the largest transfer of wealth from poor to rich in American history.</p>

        <div class="money-comparison">
            <div class="millionaire">
                <h3>What Millionaires Get:</h3>
                <div class="big-number">$81,000+</div>
                <p>in tax cuts every year</p>

                    <li>Estate tax breaks worth millions</li>
                    <li>Business tax deductions worth billions</li>

        <div class="alert-box">
            <h3>The Robbery in Simple Math:</h3>
            <p><strong>Millionaire gets: $81,000</strong><br>
            <strong>Working family gets: $263</strong><br>
            <strong>That's 308 times more money for the rich guy</strong></p>
            
            <p>While the millionaire buys a new Tesla with his tax cut, the working family's grandmother loses Medicare, their kids lose food assistance, and they pay for it all through debt their children will inherit.</p>

        <h2>📋 What's In This Democracy-Killing Bill</h2>
        
        <h3>Tax Cuts for the Rich</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Extends and expands 2017 Trump tax cuts permanently</li>
            <li>Eliminates taxes on tips and overtime (sounds good but reduces Social Security funding)</li>
            <li>Massive business tax breaks</li>
            <li>No tax on car loan interest</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Healthcare Destruction</h3>

            <li>$18 billion cut to National Institutes of Health</li>
            <li>Medicaid work requirements starting 2027</li>

            <li>Forces nearly $500 billion in Medicare cuts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Attacking the Poor</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>SNAP (food stamps) cuts - states pay more, people get less</li>
            <li>Work requirements expanded to age 64 (up from 54)</li>
            <li>Parents with kids over 7 must work to get food assistance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Border and Military Spending</h3>

            <li>701 miles of border wall construction</li>
            <li>10,000 new ICE agents, 5,000 customs officers, 3,000 Border Patrol agents</li>
            <li>Kicks 1.4 million undocumented immigrants off Medicaid</li>
            <li>Massive defense contractor profits</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="status-update">
            <h2>🏛️ CURRENT STATUS - THE BILL PASSED!</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 22, 2025, early morning<br>
            <strong>House Vote:</strong> 215-214 (passed by ONE vote)<br>
            <strong>What's Next:</strong> Goes to Senate where it needs 51 votes to pass<br>
            <strong>The Damage:</strong> Adds $2-3 trillion to national debt over 10 years</p>
            
            <p>Only 2 Republicans voted against it (Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio). Every single Democrat voted against this assault on democracy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>🎯 THE BRUTAL TRUTH</h2>
        
        <div class="alert-box">
            <p><strong>This isn't tax reform - it's the complete destruction of American democracy and the biggest robbery in world history.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>The Democracy Part:</h3>
            <p>Trump can now ignore any court order. Your constitutional rights are now suggestions. Federal judges are now powerless. The separation of powers is dead.</p>
            
            <h3>The Money Part:</h3>
            <p>Billionaires get tens of thousands while working families lose healthcare, food assistance, and pay through massive debt. A millionaire's tax cut could buy a luxury car while a working family's "relief" couldn't cover a tank of gas.</p>
            
            <h3>The Reality:</h3>
            <p><strong>The little people are getting completely destroyed.</strong> This bill takes money from programs that help Americans survive and hands it to billionaires as tax cuts. It's like robbing a food bank to buy yachts for rich people, then calling it "economic relief."</p>
            
            <p><strong>This is the biggest con job in American history</strong> - destroying democracy and robbing from the poor to give to the rich, all while calling it patriotic.</p>
